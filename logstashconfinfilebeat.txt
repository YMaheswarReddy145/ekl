Logstash is going to take the input form the file beat servers and send output to elastic search.
so now we need to write some logstash configuration on the server to accept the input and store the output in elasticsearch

1. Login in to the ELK instance.
2. provide sudo -i command to become a root user
3. give ls command to get the file list or else directly give the below command
4.  cat /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf if we open this file we will have the below data
     input {
       beats {
         port => 5044
       }
     }

     output {
       elasticsearch {
         hosts => ["https://localhost:9200"]
         index => "%{[@metadata][beat]}-%{[@metadata][version]}"
         user => "elastic"
         password => "REPLACE-YOUR_PASSWORD"
         ssl_certificate_verification => false
       }
     }
    Here we are accepting the input form beats with the port number of 5044.
    The output information we are storing of elasticsearch and we have to provide the user and password to connect
       provide the username and password from which we have taken copy of data after installing the ekl  and save the file.

5. Once the above thing is completed restart the logstash with below command. here tail help to see the lof of logstash
     systemctl restart logstash ; tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log

6. Once the above thing is completed give ctrl+c to exit from it.

7. now provide netstat -lntp and check the logs
